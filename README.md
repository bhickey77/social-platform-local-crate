## Deployment

1. Create AWS account.
1. Create S3 bucket.
1. Retrieve keys from AWS
* Click account username in navbar
* Select 'My Security Credentials'
* Select access keys
* Click 'Create new access key'
4. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Herkoku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add environment variables
* `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
* `aws_access_key_id` with key from step 3
* `aws_secret_access_key` with key from step 3
* `bucket_name` with bucket name from step 2
* do not touch `DATABASE_URL`, automatically populated by Heroku PostgreSQL
* `multer_dest` with `/app/tmp/uploads/`
* add `EMAIL_USERNAME` that you want nodemailer to send from
* add `EMAIL_PASSWORD` for email acct that you want nodemailer to send from
10. Push project to heroku

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `local_crate` and create a `person` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE person (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `prime_app` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Download (Don't Clone) This Repository

* Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Clone or Download` button and select `Download Zip`.
* Unzip the project and start with the code in that folder.
* Create a new GitHub project and push this code to the new repository.

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

* `src/` contains the React application
* `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
* `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
* `server/` contains the Express App
